## About ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
This was one of the first projects I created and it utilized all my knowledge; which was relatively not so much.
This site used only JavaScript and HTML.
I thought the idea of L-Systems were fascinating (and still do) and so I decided to make a platform where people could share their L-System seeds.
The project was mainly an exercise to create *something* and it definitely was something.
